## 10/14/2025 10 AM - Set up the clock module  

Made the clock module schematic following the schematic that Ben Eater made. It took me a little bit for me to figure out what RV1 was turns out it was a Potentiometer. I have also stared work on the a-register. I still need to figure out how to make it different from the one Ben Eater made so I'm not just copying his schematic and calling it my own. ![Screenshot_20251014_104442.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjIwMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0414950fb8ee1dacb4ae17ba9ccf1d42f8d0abc1/Screenshot_20251014_104442.png)  

## 10/14/2025 11 AM - layed out the schematic for the a-register and b-register  

I got the a-register schematic layed out and all the connections set up. sense i just needed to grab the components and nothing was really hard to find it didn't take to hard to make. sense the b register is basically the same (the only difference is the output names) I just copied the existing schematic file and hierarchical sheet and edited it to make it work.

## 10/19/2025 - Made the scematic for the ALU and flags register  

set up the flags register and the ALU schematic. it wasn't to hard to do but i did figure out how to make the schematic look better so it probably looks better then my previous schematics. I also figured out that there is a version control function built into KiCad though i may stick to the command line for the future.

## 10/21/2025 - Made the MAR module  

I made the schematic for the MAR module witch was pretty easy as non of the parts needed swapped out. I didn't really learn any thing new in the process other then if you hold control you can move things off the grid.

## 10/22/2025 - Make a symbol for the 74189 ram chip  

Sense i couldn't find a symbol or a alternative that works with out extensive upgrades to the rest of the computer i decided to make a symbol biased on data sheet linked to by Ben Eater.
I managed it by essentially copying the connection diagram from the data sheet and turning it into a symbol then using the block diagram to figure out the what pins where outputs.
I figgured out how to use the symbol editor and how to tell what pins are inputs and what pins are outputs.

## 10/25/2025 6 PM - Made the RAM module  

I made the ram module for the PC. but sense i used a custom symbol for one of the chips i need it isn't as clean as i would have hoped but it works.
It was a little harder then the other modules because the custom symbols didn't match the pin names of the symbols on the reference schematic so i needed to make sure that i was matching the pin names and not the pin numbers.

## 10/25/2025 7 PM - Made the program counter  

I made the program counter witch is the easiest part of the entire project.
For this one the hardest part was just making it look nice witch didn't take to long and wasn't to hard.
