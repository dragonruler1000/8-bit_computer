## 10/14/2025 10 AM - Set up the clock module  

Made the clock module schematic following the schematic that Ben Eater made. It took me a little bit for me to figure out what RV1 was turns out it was a Potentiometer. I have also stared work on the a-register. I still need to figure out how to make it different from the one Ben Eater made so I'm not just copying his schematic and calling it my own. ![Screenshot_20251014_104442.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjIwMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0414950fb8ee1dacb4ae17ba9ccf1d42f8d0abc1/Screenshot_20251014_104442.png)  

## 10/14/2025 11 AM - layed out the schematic for the a-register and b-register  

I got the a-register schematic layed out and all the connections set up. sense i just needed to grab the components and nothing was really hard to find it didn't take to hard to make. sense the b register is basically the same (the only difference is the output names) I just copied the existing schematic file and hierarchical sheet and edited it to make it work.

## 10/19/2025 - Made the scematic for the ALU and flags register  

set up the flags register and the ALU schematic. it wasn't to hard to do but i did figure out how to make the schematic look better so it probably looks better then my previous schematics. I also figured out that there is a version control function built into KiCad though i may stick to the command line for the future.

## 10/21/2025 - Made the MAR module  

I made the schematic for the MAR module witch was pretty easy as non of the parts needed swapped out. I didn't really learn any thing new in the process other then if you hold control you can move things off the grid.

## 10/22/2025 - Make a symbol for the 74189 ram chip  

Sense i couldn't find a symbol or a alternative that works with out extensive upgrades to the rest of the computer i decided to make a symbol biased on data sheet linked to by Ben Eater.
I managed it by essentially copying the connection diagram from the data sheet and turning it into a symbol then using the block diagram to figure out the what pins where outputs.
I figgured out how to use the symbol editor and how to tell what pins are inputs and what pins are outputs.
